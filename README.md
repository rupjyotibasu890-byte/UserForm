## 🧩 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple **user registration system** using:
- **HTML** for the front-end form  
- **PHP** for backend logic and database interaction  
- **MySQL** database hosted on **InfinityFree**

When a user submits the registration form, the data (username, email, password) is securely inserted into a MySQL table using prepared statements. Passwords are hashed before storage for security.
